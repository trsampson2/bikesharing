## Overview
Bike sharing is a new form of getting around town in big cities.  We are looking to bring this "big city" form of transportation to Des Moines, Iowa. As this is seen as a only useful in big cities, such as New York City, a presentation was requested to show how this could be useful in a small town.  Data from New York City's Citibike was gathered and analyzed to show the demographics of the users.
